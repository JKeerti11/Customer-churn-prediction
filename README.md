# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses various machine learning models to predict customer churn in a dataset. The goal is to identify which customers are likely to leave a service based on historical data.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Data preprocessing & label encoding
- Class balancing using SMOTE
- ML models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Model persistence using `pickle`

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- imbalanced-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction-ml.git
cd customer-churn-prediction-ml
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebooks/Customer_Churn_Prediction_using_ML.ipynb
